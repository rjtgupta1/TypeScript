In TypeScript, there are several built-in types that can be used to specify the type of a variable, function parameter, or function return value. These include:

1. boolean: Represents a value that is either true or false.
2. number: Represents a numeric value, either integer or floating-point.
3. string: Represents a string of characters.
4. void: Represents the absence of a value, typically used as a return type for functions that do not return a value.
5. undefined: Represents a value that has not been defined or has been explicitly set to undefined.
6. null: Represents a null value, indicating the absence of any object value.
7. any: Represents any type of value, including values of unknown or mixed types.
8. object: Represents a non-primitive value that can be of any type.
9. unknown: Represents a value of an unknown type, which must be checked or cast to another type before it can be used.
10. never: Represents a value that can never occur, typically used as a return type for functions that will not return under any circumstances.


These types can be used to help catch errors at compile-time and to provide more information about the types of values that are expected or returned by a function or variable. Additionally, TypeScript allows for the creation of custom types using interfaces, classes, and other constructs
